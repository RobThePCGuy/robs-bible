## Chapter One

**1|<sup>1</sup>** *If thou feelest o'erwhelmed by life's "gifts," pause and wrap each one, then return them unto the sender.*

**1|<sup>2</sup>** *Be not deterred when life's affairs do reach their climax. Envision thou art peering down at thy feet, and proceed one pace at a time.*

**1|<sup>3</sup>** *When thou art uncertain which path to tread, recall they are all the same - only somewhat different.*

**1|<sup>4</sup>** *Thou mayest place thy faith in a chicken, yet it shall not dance for thee.*

**1|<sup>5</sup>** *Verily, the early worm is devoured by the bird.*

**1|<sup>6</sup>** *Lo, life is as a journey through the fog at midnight: thou mayest douse thy lamp for want of sight, yet darkness remaineth unconcerned.*

**1|<sup>7</sup>** *When thou dost spin tales, speak truth ere thou depart, lest they become lies.*

**1|<sup>8</sup>** *When life bestoweth lemons upon thee, brew thou a soup instead.*

**1|<sup>9</sup>** *Every toppled domino shall, in time, stand once more.*

**1|<sup>10</sup>** *In thy days, seek that which bringeth peace and gladness; else sow fear and woe, and reap them likewise.*

## Chapter Two

**2|<sup>1</sup>** *The sole road worth wandering is oft the hardest to discover.*

**2|<sup>2</sup>** *Stack not all thy ducks in one huddle, for they shall likely topple.*

**2|<sup>3</sup>** *He who never loseth shall ne'er know the taste of true victory.*

**2|<sup>4</sup>** *I can mend it not if 'tis broken; I but delay the inevitable.*

## Chapter Three

**3|<sup>1</sup>** *When bearing a heavy burden, heed the pack mule, which taketh pause to drink, lest its load become the master.*

**3|<sup>2</sup>** *If thou waitest upon perfection, thou shalt find it only in hindsight.*

**3|<sup>3</sup>** *If thou wouldst chase the wind, be prepared to taste the dust it beareth.*

**3|<sup>4</sup>** *Give thy finest dance upon an empty stage; the echo of thy valor shall be thy applause.*

**3|<sup>5</sup>** *When thou dost fashion mountains of molehills, recall that the moles were there first.*

**3|<sup>6</sup>** *If thou must tread upon eggshells, carry salt and pepper; for when they shatter, thou shalt have breakfast.*

---

## Chapter Four

**4|<sup>1</sup>** *Fret not over seeds that fail to sprout, for some shall flourish unseen.*

**4|<sup>2</sup>** *A hound that bayeth at every passing cloud shall surely miss the rainbow's gentle arch.*

**4|<sup>3</sup>** *Grip tightly thy crust when pigeons draw near, lest they mistake thy hand for dessert.*

**4|<sup>4</sup>** *Seek mirth in thy stumbles; though the bruise may persist, laughter doth mend swiftly.*

**4|<sup>5</sup>** *When in doubt, sweep the path before thee, that thou stumble not upon yesterday's debris.*
