Rob’s Bible
===========

Preface
-------

### And so it has been written; contained within thou shall discover answers to questions left unrequited by the almighty. Place your conviction in Rob’s Bible and observe problems subside.

### Follow my locutions as they will usher those who bear it through the dark nights. Hold on until the first light of dawn breaks the horizon. Only then will the verses within be revealed.

Chapter One
-----------

**1:<sup>1</sup>** *If thou feels inundated with life’s ‘gifts’ make time to wrap each to return to sender.*

**1:<sup>2</sup>** *Do not be deterred as ideas for managing affairs reach climax. Visualize yourself peering down at feet beneath you and take one step forward at a time.*

**1:<sup>3</sup>** *When uncertain, the right path to follow, remember they are all the same, just a little different.*

**1:<sup>4</sup>** *You can place faith in a chicken, won’t make it dance.*

**1:<sup>5</sup>** *The early worm gets eaten by the bird.*

**1:<sup>6</sup>** *Life is like driving down a foggy road at night. Turning off your headlights because you can’t see with them on, so it couldn’t be worse, right?*

**1:<sup>7</sup>** *When telling tales, deliver the truth before thou part, lest it become a lie.*

**1:<sup>10</sup>** *In life, seek things that create peace and happiness. Else find fear and despair and reap them for life.*

**1:<sup>14</sup>** *What do you do when life gives you lemons… make soup.*

**1:<sup>44</sup>** *Ultimately, every domino that has toppled over will rise anew.*

Chapter Two
-----------

**2:<sup>2</sup>** *Don’t stack all your ducks in one place… they’ll likely topple over.*
