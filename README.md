## Chapter One

**1|<sup>1</sup>** *If thou feels engulfed by life’s “gifts”, make time to wrap each one and return to sender.*

**1|<sup>2</sup>** *Do not be deterred when managing affairs reach climax. Visualize yourself peering down at the feet beneath you and take one step forward at a time.*

**1|<sup>3</sup>** *When uncertain, the right path to follow, remember they are all the same, just a little different.*

**1|<sup>4</sup>** *You may place faith in a chicken, won’t make it dance.*

**1|<sup>5</sup>** *The early worm gets eaten by the bird.*

**1|<sup>6</sup>** *Life is like driving down a foggy road at night. Turning off your headlights because you can’t see with them on, so it couldn’t be worse, right?*

**1|<sup>7</sup>** *When telling tales, deliver the truth before thou part, lest it become a lie.*

**1|<sup>8</sup>** *What do you do when life gives you lemons … make soup.*

**1|<sup>9</sup>** *Every domino that has toppled over will rise anew.*

**1|<sup>10</sup>** *In life, seek things that bring peace and happiness. Else create fear and despair and reap them for life.*

## Chapter Two

**2|<sup>1</sup>** *The only road to travel is the hardest to find.*

**2|<sup>2</sup>** *Don’t stack all your ducks in one place … they’ll likely topple over.*
